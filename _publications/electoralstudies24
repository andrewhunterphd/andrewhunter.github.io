In this paper, I examine cognitive reflection, i.e., the ability to suppress oneâ€™s spontaneous intuition to engage in higher-level analytical thinking, as a predictor of populist attitudes and candidate preferences. I develop a set of hypotheses which link the ideological content of populism to lower levels of cognitive reflection. I test these hypotheses with an original survey conducted on a representative sample of the UK population, in which respondents were asked to complete a cognitive reflection test, answer questions from a scale of populist attitudes, and respond to a conjoint experiment of hypothetical parliamentary candidates whose populist ideology is randomly attributed. I find that populist attitudes are negatively associated with cognitive reflection (p<0.05). Furthermore, I also find suggestive evidence that, with respect to candidate preferences, anti-elite and conflict-seeking attributes interact with respondent-level reflectiveness in a conjoint setting (p<0.1). However, I find no such interaction with respect to people centric attributes.
