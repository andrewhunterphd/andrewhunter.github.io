I’m a postdoctoral research fellow at the Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway, University of London. I obtained my PhD from the Department of Political Economy at King’s College London in 2023. I've also held a visiting lectureship at the European Institute at the London School of Economics, where I taught quantitative research methods.

My research interests include political cognition, elections, and populism. I use a variety of quantitative methods to address these topics, with particular emphasis on survey experiments. 

I’m a political scientist by training, but I currently work in a psychology department where I study the formation of political beliefs and the development of social norms. I am interested in bridging the gap between these two disciplines by applying concepts and methods from psychology to pertinent topics in political science.
