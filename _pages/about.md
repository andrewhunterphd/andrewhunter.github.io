I’m a postdoctoral research fellow at Royal Holloway, University of London. I completed my PhD in 2023 at King’s College London. My research interests include political cognition, elections and populism. I use a variety of quantitative methods to address these topics, but I’m mostly interested in experiments. I’m a political scientist by training, but I currently work in a psychology department where I am interested in bridging the gaps between these two disciplines. In particular, I am interested applying techniques from experimental psychology to pertinent topics in political science.
