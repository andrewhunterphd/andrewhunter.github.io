I’m a political scientist and postdoctoral research fellow at Royal Holloway, University of London. I completed my PhD at the Department of Political Economy at King’s College London in 2023. I’ve also held a visiting lectureship at the European Institute at the London School of Economics, where I taught quantitative research methods.

My research focuses on comparative political behaviour particularly the study of populism, electoral systems and support for democracy. I use a variety of quantitative methods to address these topics, with a particular emphasis on survey experiments.

I’m also interested in interdisciplinary research. I have experience working with psychologists and economists, in particular using concepts and methods from these disciplines to address pertinent topics in political science.
